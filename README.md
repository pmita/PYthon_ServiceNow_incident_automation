# Python_ServiceNow_incident_automation
Raise incidents from an excel spreadsheet directly into ServiceNow via their REST API integration

Configure excel as per your own incidents. These can be collected through powerautomation flows from Microsoft, for example. 

Backtrack incidents to the python script. Remember the data you are sending through the http request need to have a json format.

For a personalized incident you can use the REST api section from the servicenow portal. There you can generate json examples for your specific tickets you need raising.
